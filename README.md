# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

# Quickstart

You can download and run it directly through console

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5 and launch GUI:

./main.py
